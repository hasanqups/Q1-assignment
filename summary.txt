This script use XLSX module to read the Excel file and then turn it to a json format and store in 
data variable according to current date sheet.
This script uses the Puppeteer module to open a browser and navigate to Google,and 
search all keywords separetely in google,then parse the HTML and extract the suggested 
options from google by using the Cheerio module,and then collect longest and shortest option
for each keyword and write the data to our Excel file and update it.
